## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML
- CSS
- Some flexbox
- PostCSS, Autoprefixer, CSS Nano

### What I learned

It wasn't what I learned, so much as what was reinforced in me. When I took a coding bootcamp, the instructor emphasized the importance of breaking large tasks down into small pieces and and building up form there. This challenge was such a beast in size that I knew I needed to remember to do that, or I'd feel overwhelmed. So I started with the header, then once I'd finished the header, Imoved onto the area of the page just below the header. Though this seems like a slow process, it actually made completing this challenge go a lot faster, since I didn't have to go back and search through all the code to find mistakes or do something I'd forgotten to do.

### Continued Development

I guess if I were to do something like this again, I might use a framework like Bootstrap. While adding the media queries for this challenge weren't too exhaustive, there were tedious after doing everything else.
